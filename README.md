# ☁️ Cloud 9 — AI Coding Mentor

An AI-powered coding mentor that helps students **learn programming instead of just receiving answers**.

Cloud 9 combines **Google Gemini**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and a curated programming knowledge base to provide intelligent debugging, concept explanations, and personalized coding practice.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Cloud 9 is designed as a virtual coding mentor that guides students through programming problems by providing explanations, hints, and practice questions instead of complete solutions.

The application follows a mentor-style teaching approach, encouraging users to develop problem-solving skills while learning programming concepts more effectively.

# 🧠 How It Works

1. User signs in.
2. Selects Debug, Explain, or Practice mode.
3. Sends code or a programming question.
4. The system searches the knowledge base using RAG.
5. Gemini generates a mentor-style response.
6. Conversation is stored.
7. User provides feedback to improve the system.
